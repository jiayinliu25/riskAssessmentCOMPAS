    "- Violent Recidivism Risk Scale: inputs include history of violence, history of non-compliance.. Etc.\n",
    "- The scale is constructed from the history of noncompliance scale, Vocational Education Scale, current age, age-at-first-arrest, history of violence scale \n",
    "- Each item is then multiplied by weight (w) whose size is determined by the strength of the itemâ€™s relationship to person offense recidivism. The weighted items are then added together: \n",

    "- The resulting scale scores are transformed into decile scores range from 1 (low) to 10 (high) and the deciles are obtained by ranking the scale scores of a normative group in ascending order and divided into 10 groups\n",
